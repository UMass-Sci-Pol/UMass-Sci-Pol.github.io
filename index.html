                                    <p>I am majoring in physics and astronomy, and have been involved in astrophysics research since my first year at UMass where I focus on galaxy evolution and advanced optical systems that can be used for both astrophysics and medical imaging. My interests in policy stem from my early involvement in high school with activities such as student government and representing students at the MA state legislature. Combining my interests in science and governance, I realized the significant lack of science representation in policymaking limits the pace and directions of research as a consequence of funding and national priorities. Working in research groups in the U.S. and abroad, I found that the deficit in scientific expertise in government is quite universal. I hope to help change that by motivating us to be more active advocates for ethical and effective science.</p>

I first saw the importance of science in policy making as a member of my high school’s Model UN team, and since then have been interested in facilitating communication between science and policymakers on issues such as science funding and education, gene editing, and the potential legal, political, and ethical implications of epigenetic research. I hope to facilitate evidence-based policymaking and ethical research throughout my career as a physician-scientist.</p>
